The codebase, devOps and product management infrastructures are mature, wide in depth, and the team is very active, engaged and experienced in various complementary domains.  Role: I mostly work towards adapting existing features and frameworks to allow non-critical resources to be dynamically loaded as users interact with the site. This involves understanding some of the more technical aspects of frontend development and benchmarking various performance-related metrics against new strategies of bundling and serving the source code.  Technologies:         React, Redux, and Typescript during main development      Webpack for module bundling      Jest with react-testing-library for systematic unit testing      Adobe Experience Manager for Content Management System      Java for the backend      Selenium Webdriver with Cucumber for end-to-end testing"

            "details": "My research was in the field of geometric analysis, in particular the study of the Ricci Flow on geometric objects of higher dimension. This area of mathematics is broadly conderned with deriving knowledge of geometric objects by analyzing certain Partial Differential Equations arising from the underlying geometric property of the object. This led me to focus on computational approaches to solve these abstract questions, and I eventually decided to move my efforts entirely to software development and engineering."
